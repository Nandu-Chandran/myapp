“The basic fallacy that you are carrying within you is that you always loved somebody.

"This is one of the most significant things about all human beings: their love is always for somebody. It is addressed and the moment you address your love, you destroy it. It is as if you are saying, ‘I will breathe only for you, and when you are not there, then how can I breathe?’

“Love should be like breathing. It should be just a quality in you wherever you are, with whomsoever you are. Even if you are alone, love goes on overflowing from you. It is not a question of being in love with someone – it is a question of being love.”
